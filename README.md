# proj4-holbrook-working

## The Project

For this project we were asked to work with expenditure and consumption data for a chosen population and to use the nutritional outcomes we found in the population to craft policy proposals and analyse their economic impact.

## The Data

We chose to work with CA households and create new policy proposals to improve the health and wellbeing of foodstamps users.
